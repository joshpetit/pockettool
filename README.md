# pockettool
pockettool is a project I am not currently working on but may revist in the future,
the one feature I did create though is still up and usable.

## QuickSend
A way to send a link (or any text) to a device that has internet access.

### Usage
Visit [quicksend.web.app](https://quicksend.web.app)
#### Sending a link
Underneath "Save a link" you can type in the code you would
like to be used to retrieve the link or text. Once the link
to send is pasted in click on send and then it will save the
link temporarily to the database until someone types in that
same code in the "Restore a link" section.

#### Restoring a link
On the [quicksend](https://quicksend.web.app) site, type in the code
you want to retrieve and then click "Restore", the link or text should
appear in the textbox. Click on the icon next to the restore button to
copy to your clip tray.

Once the code is retrieved once, the entry is deleted from the database,
so it can be reused later on. I recommend using a specific code then, but
I doubt this will receive a lot of traffic haha. Have a nice day :)
